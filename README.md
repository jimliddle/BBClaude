An attempt at a single Web Page implementation of Claude for Blackberry.

This is not working as unlike the OpenAI and Gemini version that I created, correct. Anthropic's API, is designed for server-side use, and does not provide permissive CORS headers that would allow direct requests from arbitrary web pages in a browser. They expect API interactions to happen from a secure backend environment, not directly from a user's browser. Perhaps possiblev to get around it with a CORS proxy and perhaps something I will come back to
